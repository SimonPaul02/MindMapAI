# Test Orchestrator

The code in this folder creates a very simple orchestrator. The orchestrator assumes a basic 3 component architecture (i.e. it does only work with one single model. Multiple models are not supported).

It handles all interactions between the different copmonents of the grpc services of task, model handler and model.
